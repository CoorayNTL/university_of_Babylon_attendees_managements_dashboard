# web-vitals
The web-vitals library uses the buffered flag for PerformanceObserver, allowing it to access performance entries that occurred before the library was loaded.

This means you do not need to load this library early in order to get accurate performance data. In general, this library should be deferred until after other user-impacting code has loaded.

From npm
You can install this library from npm by running

npm install web-vitals
